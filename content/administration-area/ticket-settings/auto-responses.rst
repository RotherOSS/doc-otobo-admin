Auto Responses
==============

Quick and transparent service is vital to maintaining a good working relationship with your customer. Email, fax, social media and other non-real-time communications are patient, but you want to engage your customer immediately upon receipt of a request.

OTOBO allows you to respond to a customer immediately upon receipt of a request giving the customers instantaneous feedback assuring them that their request is in processing, establishing expectation.

Automatic responses can be sent to customers based on the occurrence of certain events, such as the creation of a ticket in a specific queue, the receipt of a follow-up message in regards to a closed or rejected ticket, etc.

Use this screen to add automatic responses for use in queues. A fresh OTOBO installation contains some automatic responses by default. The automatic response management screen is available in the *Auto Responses* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

   Auto Response Variables

For example, the variable ``<OTOBO_TICKET_TicketNumber>`` expands to the ticket number allowing a template to include something like the following.

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#<OTOBO_TICKET_TicketNumber>

This tag expands, for example to:

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#2018101042000012
