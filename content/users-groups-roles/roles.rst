The following settings are available when adding or editing this resource. The fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.

Name \*
   The name of this resource. Any type of characters can be entered to this field including uppercase letters and spaces. The name will be displayed in the overview table.

Validity \*
   Set the validity of this resource. Each resource can be used in OTOBO only, if this field is set to *valid*. Setting this field to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily* will disable the use of the resource.
