Session Management
==================

Administrators of web-based applications need to have access to the information who's connected to the system and, if required, delete unwanted sessions.

OTOBO offers the session management to quickly get an overview of agent and customer sessions, unique agents and customers currently logged in and the ability to kill sessions with just a mouse click.

Use this screen to manage logged in user sessions in the system. The session management screen is available in the *Session Management* module of the *Administration* group.
